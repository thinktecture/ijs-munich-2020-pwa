Progressive Web Apps are a great cross-platform application model, even if somewhat restricted in use—until now, that is. Project Fugu is an initiative led by Google, Microsoft, and Intel. Their goal: a more capable web. Home screen shortcuts, clipboard access, and native file system access are only a few examples of Fugu’s powerful APIs. Are you ready to superpower your Progressive Web App?

In this full-day hands-on tutorial, Christian Liebel, PWA specialist at Thinktecture, shows you the objective of Project Fugu and demonstrates some of its APIs with the help of a sample application, a (minimal) clone of MS Paint. All attendees are going to build a working, Fugu-enabled PWA.

## Setup Instructions
